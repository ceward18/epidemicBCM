## Simulation Study

### Data Generation

dataGenerationFixed.R generates 50 simulated epidemics in each of six
scenarios:

Three different alarm functions:

-   Threshold alarm
-   Hill alarm
-   Power alarm

Two different bandwidths for smoothing

-   14-day moving average
-   30-day moving average
